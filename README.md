# ProceduralNoise.jl

This is a module for the [Julia language](https://julialang.org) for procedurally generating noise, such as [gradient noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_noise).
Currently only [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) in 3 dimensions is implemented, but there is more to come.
